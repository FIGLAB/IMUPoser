## 1. Clone (or Fork!) this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/FIGLAB/IMUPoser.git
```
 
## 2. Create a virtual environment
We recommend using conda. Tested on `Ubuntu 18.04`, with `python 3.7`.

```bash
conda create -n "imuposer" python=3.7
conda activate imuposer
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e src/
```

## 3. Training Steps
1. Start by preprocessing the AMASS and DIP-IMU datasets [scripts/1. Preprocessing](scripts/1.%20Preprocessing). Run all files in order.
2. Train the model [scripts/2. Train/run\_combos.sh](scripts/2.%20Train/run_combos.sh)

## Coming Soon!
1. IMUPoser Dataset
2. Real-Time Demo
